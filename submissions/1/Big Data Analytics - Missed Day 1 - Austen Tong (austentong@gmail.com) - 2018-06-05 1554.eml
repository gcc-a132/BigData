Hi Prof. Tenney,

I was supposed to be in your class today, but due to a mix up on YorkU=E2=
=80=99s end, I was unable to access the course=E2=80=99s Moodle, or even fi=
nd the classroom the course was taking place until this afternoon. As a res=
ult, I was forced to miss the first day of  the course.

I spent the morning and much of the afternoon emailing York, and York=E2=80=
=99s IT coordinator, Paul Elo, has now sent me the course=E2=80=99s welcome=
 package, and I will take the time to review the material at home. He will =
also drop by tomorrow morning during class to make sure I have proper acces=
s to the VPN, internet, etc. 

Is there anything important that I missed on the first day? Reading the cou=
rse outline, I understand that there are daily assignments. As my absence f=
rom class today was out of my control, will I be able to hand in the daily =
assignment one day late? 

I=E2=80=99m looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Cheers,
Austen
